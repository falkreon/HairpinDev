Pattern-Matching Deobfuscation


This project creates a mapping for deobfuscated code based on patterns recognized within its
class files, and known relationships between the classes. Specific interest is placed on
creating live mappings for Minecraft and Starmade.


The code is *extremely* messy right now. Since I've discovered more interest than expected,
I will be cleaning up this codebase and formatting it to conform to a uniform 4-space indent
and Oracle guidelines.

For Pincraft (the Minecraft Hairpin mappings), generated mappings should match mcp and Forge
wherever possible.
